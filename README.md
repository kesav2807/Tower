# Tower
Here's a basic breakdown of your HTML structure:

HTML Document Structure:

<html>: The root element of an HTML page.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as links to external resources (stylesheets and scripts).
<link>: Used to link external resources, such as stylesheets.
<script>: Used to include JavaScript files.
<body>: Contains the content of the HTML document.
Content:

An <input> element with the id attribute set to "numDisk" and a placeholder for user input.
A <button> element with the onclick attribute set to "makeMove," triggering a JavaScript function. It also has an id attribute set to "makemove" and a width attribute set to "40" (although the width attribute is not typically used for buttons).
A <div> element with the class attribute set to "game" and id attribute set to "game."
Script Files:

Links to external JavaScript files: "hanoi.js" and "tower.js."
Functionality:

The "makeMove" function is referenced in the button's onclick attribute. This function is expected to be defined in the "hanoi.js" file.
The structure suggests that this HTML is part of a project related to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
Without the content of the "styles.css," "hanoi.js," and "tower.js" files, and the README, it's challenging to provide specific details about the functionality and usage of your project. If you have specific questions or if there's anything you'd like to know or add, please provide more details.
